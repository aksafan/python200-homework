# --- Mini-Project — Job Application Helper ---

# Task 1: Setup and System Prompt

# Load your API key and initialize the client. Then define a get_completion() helper function (as seen in the prompt engineering lesson) that takes a messages list and returns the model's text response:

from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI

load_dotenv()
client = OpenAI()

def get_completion(messages, model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.7):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature,
        max_completion_tokens=400
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# Next, write a system prompt that sets up the model as a job application coach. Be specific: give it a role, a description of who it's helping, and clear behavioral constraints.
# At a minimum, your system prompt should instruct the model to:
# Stay focused on job application materials
# Always remind the user to review and edit its output before submitting anywhere
# Acknowledge that it may not know the user's specific industry norms, and that the user should use their own judgment
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are a job application coach.
You help users improve their resumes, cover letters, and other job application materials.
You will stay focused on job application materials and provide constructive feedback.
Always remind the user to review and edit your output before submitting it anywhere. 
Acknowledge that you may not know the user's specific industry norms, and that the user should use their own judgment when applying your suggestions.
"""
print(f"SYSTEM_PROMPT: {SYSTEM_PROMPT}")

# Add a comment explaining at least one deliberate choice you made in writing the system prompt and why.
#
# I chose to explicitly instruct the model to stay focused on job application materials and provide constructive feedback because this ensures that the model does not flee into unrelated topics.
# Additionally, highlighting the need for user review and acknowledging potential gaps in industry knowledge helps manage user expectations and encourages critical check and validation of the results.

# Before you move on — check:
# If you print your system prompt and read it aloud, does it sound like a clear briefing for a specific assistant?
# If it's vague or could apply to almost any task, try adding more specificity.
# The more concrete your system prompt, the more predictable and useful the model's behavior will be throughout the project.


# Task 2: Bullet Point Rewriter

# Write a standalone rewrite_bullets() function that takes a list of resume bullet points and returns improved versions.
# This function will later be called from inside the chatbot loop.

# Your function should:

# Use delimiters to clearly separate the user's bullet points from your instructions
# Ask for the output as a JSON list where each item has "original" and "improved" keys
# Parse the JSON response and print both versions of each bullet side by side

def rewrite_bullets(bullets: list[str]) -> list[dict]:
    # Format the bullets into a delimited block
    bullet_text = "\n".join(f"- {b}" for b in bullets)

    prompt = f"""
    You are a professional resume coach helping a career changer.
    Rewrite each resume bullet point below to be more specific, results-oriented, and compelling.
    Use strong action verbs. Do not invent facts that aren't implied by the original.

    Respond ONLY with valid JSON, no other text. Each item should have two keys:
    "original" (the original bullet) and "improved" (your rewritten version).

    Bullet points:
    ```
    {bullet_text}
    ```
    """

    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    # Your code here: call get_completion(), parse the JSON, and return the result

    import json

    try:
        raw = get_completion(messages).strip()
        # Here I'm checking for "```json" part and strip it
        if raw.startswith("```"):
            raw = raw.split("\n", 1)[1].rsplit("```", 1)[0].strip()
        result = json.loads(raw)

        return result
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Failed to parse JSON: {e}")

# Test it with these starter bullets:
bullets = [
    "Helped customers with their problems",
    "Made reports for the management team",
    "Worked with a team to finish the project on time"
]
print("Bullet Point:", bullets)
print("Bullet Point Rewriter Result:", rewrite_bullets(bullets))

# Bullet Point Rewriter Result: [{'original': 'Helped customers with their problems', 'improved': 'Resolved customer inquiries and issues efficiently, enhancing satisfaction and loyalty.'}, {'original': 'Made reports for the management team', 'improved': 'Compiled and presented detailed analytical reports for the management team, facilitating data-driven decision-making.'}, {'original': 'Worked with a team to finish the project on time', 'improved': 'Collaborated with a cross-functional team to successfully deliver the project ahead of schedule, ensuring alignment with strategic goals.'}]

# Add a comment: What makes these bullets weak, and what kinds of changes did the model suggest?
#
# The original bullets are weak because they are vague, lack specific details, and do not highlight the impact or results of the actions taken.
# They also use generic phrases like "helped customers" and "made reports" without highlighting the achievements or demonstrating the skills involved.
# The model's suggestions improve the bullets by adding specificity (e.g., "Resolved customer inquiries and issues efficiently"), emphasizing results (e.g., "enhancing satisfaction and loyalty"), and using stronger action verbs (e.g., "Compiled and presented detailed analytical reports").
# The improved versions also provide context that makes the candidate's contributions clearer and more compelling to potential employers.

# Before you move on — check:
# Did json.loads() succeed without raising an error? If not, try adding "Respond ONLY with valid JSON, no other text." to your prompt.
# The model sometimes adds a preamble like "Here is the JSON:" that breaks the parser.
# Are both the original and improved versions printing clearly for each bullet?
# Do the improvements feel meaningfully better, or are they just rearranged words? If the output is weak, try making your prompt more specific about what "strong" looks like.



# Task 3: Cover Letter Generator

# Write a generate_cover_letter() function that takes a job title and a brief description of the user's background, and returns a cover letter opening paragraph.
# Use few-shot prompting: include at least two examples of strong cover letter openings in your prompt before asking for the new one.
# Your examples should demonstrate the tone and style you want — confident, specific, and not generic.

def generate_cover_letter(job_title: str, background: str) -> str:
    prompt = f"""
    You write strong cover letter opening paragraphs for career changers.
    The paragraph should be 3-5 sentences: confident, specific, and free of clichés.

    Here are two examples of the style and tone you should match:

    Example 1:
    Role: Data Analyst at a healthcare nonprofit
    Background: Seven years as a registered nurse, recently completed a data analytics bootcamp.
    Opening: After seven years as a registered nurse, I've spent my career making decisions
    under pressure using incomplete information — which turns out to be excellent training for
    data analysis. I recently completed a data analytics program where I built dashboards
    tracking patient outcomes across departments. I'm excited to bring that combination of
    clinical context and technical skill to [Company]'s mission-driven work.

    Example 2:
    Role: Junior Software Engineer at a fintech startup
    Background: Ten years in retail banking operations, self-taught Python developer for two years.
    Opening: I spent a decade on the operations side of banking, watching technology decisions
    get made by people who had never processed a wire transfer or resolved a failed ACH batch.
    That frustration turned into curiosity, and two years of self-teaching Python later, I'm
    ready to be on the other side of those decisions. I'm applying to [Company] because your
    work on payment infrastructure is exactly where my domain expertise and new technical skills
    intersect.

    Now write an opening paragraph for this person:
    Role: {job_title}
    Background: {background}
    Opening:
    """

    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    # Your code here: call get_completion() and return the result
    return get_completion(messages).strip()

# Test it with:

job_title = "Junior Data Engineer"
background = "Five years of experience as a middle school math teacher; recently completed \
a Python course and built data pipelines using Prefect and Pandas."
# Print the generated paragraph.
print(f"Job title: {job_title}")
print(f"Background: {background}")
print(f"The generated paragraph: {generate_cover_letter(job_title, background)}")
# The generated paragraph: After five years of guiding middle school students through the complexities of math, I’ve developed a knack for breaking down intricate concepts into digestible pieces — a skill that's directly transferable to data engineering.
# Recently, I immersed myself in a Python course, where I built data pipelines using Prefect and Pandas, transforming raw data into actionable insights.
# I'm eager to leverage my teaching experience and newfound technical expertise to contribute to [Company]'s innovative data solutions and drive impactful results.

# Add a comment: Why did you choose those particular examples? What does the few-shot pattern help control in the output?
# I chose those examples because they demonstrate a strong, confident tone while also being specific about the candidate's background and how it relates to the new role.
# Both examples clearly articulate the candidate's unique value proposition and show a clear connection between their past experience and the job they're applying for.

# Before you move on — check:
#
# Does the output feel tailored to the specific person, or is it generic? (Phrases like "I am excited to bring my unique skills..." are a red flag.)
# Does it avoid inventing credentials the user didn't mention?
# Try changing the job title and background to something very different and see if the output adapts. If it sounds the same regardless of input, your prompt may not be specific enough.



# Task 4: Moderation Check

# Before sending any user input to the model in your chatbot loop, run it through OpenAI's moderation endpoint first.
# Write an is_safe(text) function that:

# Calls client.moderations.create() with model="omni-moderation-latest"
# Returns True if the input is not flagged, False if it is
# Prints a short, respectful message if the input is flagged, asking the user to rephrase

def is_safe(text: str) -> bool:
    result = client.moderations.create(
        model="omni-moderation-latest",
        input=text
    )
    flagged = result.results[0].flagged
    # Your code here: return True if safe, False if flagged, and print a message if flagged
    if flagged:
        print("Your message was flagged by our moderation system. Please rephrase and try again.")
        categories = [category for category, flagged in vars(result.results[0].categories).items() if flagged]
        print(f"Triggered result categories: {categories}")

        return False
    return True

# Test your function with at least two inputs — one that should pass and one that should be flagged — and print the result of each test.
# You want to confirm this is working correctly before wiring it into the loop.
safe_input = "Can you help me improve my resume bullets?"
flagged_input = "I want to write a cover letter that will kill the employer."

print(f"Testing safe input: '{safe_input}'")
print(f"Is it safe? - {is_safe(safe_input)}")
print(f"Testing flagged input: '{flagged_input}'")
print(f"Is it safe? - {is_safe(flagged_input)}")

# Before you move on — check:
#
# Does your flagged test case actually get caught? If not, try a more explicit phrase.
# Does your safe test case pass without triggering any warning?
# What happens if you test a borderline phrase? Look at result.results[0].categories to see which category was triggered.


# Task 5: The Chatbot Loop

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_chatbot()

# Before you move on — check:
#
# Have a short conversation with your bot (3-4 exchanges) without using the bullet or cover letter features.
# After each turn, add a temporary print(len(messages)) to confirm the history is growing. Remove it when you're done.
# Ask the bot something from turn 1, then reference it in turn 3 (e.g., give your name in the first message, then ask "what did I tell you my name was?").
# If it can't remember, check that you're appending both user and assistant messages to messages after every turn.
#
# Try triggering the bullet rewriter and cover letter generator from inside the loop and confirm they still work.
#
# Type quit and confirm the bot exits cleanly.


# Task 6: Ethics Reflection
# Choose one of the following and add a comment at the top of your reflection noting which format you chose:
# Option A — Comment block: At the bottom of project_05.py, add a comment block responding to the questions below. Write at least 3-5 sentences total.
# Option B — Short video: Record a 2-3 minute Loom or YouTube video walking through the same questions and paste the link as a comment at the bottom of project_05.py. This can be submitted as your second LMS link.
# Respond to at least two of the following three questions:
#
# Your bot was trained on text written by and about certain kinds of people. How might this produce biased advice? Could it favor certain communication styles, industries, or cultural backgrounds?
# What could go wrong if a job-seeker submitted the bot's output directly — without reviewing it — to a real employer?
# What is one guardrail you would add if you were deploying this tool professionally? (A guardrail is any design choice that reduces the chance of harm — a UI warning, a moderation filter, a usage policy, a disclaimer, or something else entirely.)

# Option A was chosen for this reflection:
# - The bot was trained on a large dataset of text, and this may include biases in communication styles, industries, or cultural/ethnical backgrounds.
# - As a result, the advice it provides could favor certain approaches, people, groups, and may not be universally applicable or culturally/ethnically appropriate.
# If a job-seeker were to submit the bot's output directly without reviewing it, they might mistakenly show inaccurate (or even inappropriate) information or fail to meet industry norms, potentially harming their chances of getting a position.
# - One guardrail I would add is a mandatory review step by human where user must confirm that they have read, understood and approved the result before submission, together with a clear disclaimer highlighting that the advice is generated by an AI and should be critically evaluated.

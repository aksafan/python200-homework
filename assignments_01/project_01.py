# Task 5: Correlation and Multiple Comparisons
# For each numeric explanatory variable, compute the Pearson correlation with happiness score using scipy.stats.pearsonr and log the coefficient and p-value.
#
# Each time you run a statistical test at alpha = 0.05, you accept a 5% chance of a false positive -- concluding a relationship is real when it isn't. That's a reasonable risk for a single test. But when you run many tests at once, those small risks add up. If you run 20 independent tests, you'd expect roughly one false positive just by chance, even if none of the relationships are actually real. The more tests you run, the more likely you are to stumble onto something that looks significant but isn't.
# This is called the multiple comparisons problem, and it's one of the most common sources of misleading findings in data analysis. A simple and widely used fix is the Bonferroni correction: divide your significance threshold by the number of tests you ran.
#
# Count how many correlation tests you performed, then compute:
#
# adjusted_alpha = 0.05 / number_of_tests
#
# Log which correlations are significant at the original alpha = 0.05, and which remain significant after applying the correction. You may find that some results that looked significant at first don't hold up under the stricter threshold -- that's a useful finding in itself.

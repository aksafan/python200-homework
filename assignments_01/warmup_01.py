# Why are the median and mean so different for data2? Add your answer as a comment in the code.

print("Conclusion: For Q1 t-test shows that there is a statistically significant difference between group_a and group_b scores.")
print("Group A scores are less than Group B scores. P-value is 1.5471178249432407e-06 that is less than chosen significance level (0.05).")

# --- Pipelines ---

# Pipeline Question 1
# A data pipeline is a sequence of processing steps where each step takes in data, transforms it, and passes the result to the next.
# You don't need a special framework to build one -- chaining plain functions together is often enough.
#
# Given the array below, which contains some missing values scattered throughout:
#
# arr = np.array([12.0, 15.0, np.nan, 14.0, 10.0, np.nan, 18.0, 14.0, 16.0, 22.0, np.nan, 13.0])
#
# Implement the following three functions and then connect them in a data_pipeline() function.
#
# create_series(arr) : takes a NumPy array and returns a pandas Series with the name "values".
# clean_data(series) : takes the Series, removes any NaN values using .dropna(), and returns the cleaned Series.
# summarize_data(series) -- takes the cleaned Series and returns a dictionary with four keys: "mean", "median", "std", and "mode". For mode, use series.mode()[0] to get a single value.
# data_pipeline(arr) -- calls the three functions above in sequence and returns the summary dictionary.
#
# Call data_pipeline(arr) and print each key and its value from the result.
# This is the last answer to put in warmups_01.py. Congrats!!!
# The next question will be in prefect_warmup.py, but will implement the same functionality using Prefect instead of plain Python.

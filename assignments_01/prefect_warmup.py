# --- Pipelines ---

# Pipeline Question 2
# The answer to this question should go in prefect_warmup.py, not warmups_01.py.
# Rebuild the pipeline from Q1 using Prefect. Copy your three functions from Pipeline Question 1 (create_series, clean_data, summarize_data) into this file and turn them into Prefect tasks using @task.
# Turn data_pipeline() into a Prefect flow using @flow. Inside the flow, call the three tasks in order and return the summary dictionary.
#
# Add this block at the bottom of the file so the flow runs when you execute the script directly:
#
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     pipeline_flow()
#
# Run your workflow from the terminal:
#
# python prefect_warmup.py
#
# The summary values should match what you got in Question 1.
# Finally, add a comment block at the bottom of prefect_warmup.py answering these two questions:
#
# This pipeline is simple -- just three small functions on a handful of numbers. Why might Prefect be more overhead than it is worth here?
# Describe some realistic scenarios where a framework like Prefect could still be useful, even if the pipeline logic itself stays simple like in this case.

# This pipeline is simple -- just three small functions on a handful of numbers. Why might Prefect be more overhead than it is worth here?
# It spins up a server to run, and another one for UI. More deps, more complexity. Not even a half of the Prefect features were used.

# Describe some realistic scenarios where a framework like Prefect could still be useful, even if the pipeline logic itself stays simple like in this case.
# ETL pipeline to generate reports for a business.

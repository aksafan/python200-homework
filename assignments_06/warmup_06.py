# --- RAG Concepts ---

# Concepts Question 1
#
# Three teams at a software company are each building a different AI project.
# Add a comment block to your code that identifies the best approach — prompt engineering, fine-tuning, or RAG — for each scenario, and gives a 1-2 sentence explanation of your reasoning.
#
# Scenario A: A legal team wants an assistant that can answer questions about their internal policy library — hundreds of PDFs that are updated every quarter.
# RAG would be the best approach for this scenario, cause it helps the assistant to retrieve relevant information from the hundreds of PDFs which are frequently updated.
# This way, we don't need to retrain the model every time there is a change.
#
# Scenario B: A startup wants their model to write product copy in a very specific brand voice — a dry, minimalist style that does not appear much online. They have 3,000 examples their in-house writers produced over the years.
# Fine-tuning would be the best approach, cause with 3,000 examples of the desired brand voice, we have enough data to let the model learn the specific style and tone that the startup wants for their product copy.
# This approach will be more effective than prompt engineering or RAG for achieving a consistent and unique brand voice, as fine-tuning allows the model to discover the specific patterns and nuances of the writing style, and not relying on just prompts or RAG.
#
# Scenario C: A data analyst needs to ask an LLM questions about a single two-page report she just received. She does not need this to work for any other document.
# Prompt engineering would be the best approach, cause the analyst only needs to ask questions about a single two-page report and do that once.
# Prompting engineering will help her to craft specific prompts to explain the model what she exactly wants with minimum overhead of building an index or fine-tuning a model.
# This is the quickest and most efficient solution among others.

# Concepts Question 2
#
# AI hallucinations (responses that sound confident but are wrong) can be particularly difficult to detect. Add a comment to your code answering this:
#
# Why is a confidently wrong answer more harmful than one that says "I am not sure"? Give one example of a real situation where a confident hallucination could cause harm.
# A confidently wrong answer can be more harmful than one that says "I am not sure", cause it can mislead users and make them believe in incorrect information
# This can lead to bad decisions and/or actions based on falsy information.
# For example, a medical chatbot confidently provides a wrong diagnosis or treatment recommendation to a patient. This can be crucial and very harmful to their health or even be dangerous to life.
#
# Think about the tone of the response as well as its content — why does the way the model expresses an answer affect how much we trust it?
# The tone of the response can greatly affect how much we trust it because a confident tone can create an illusion of trustworthy and expertise, despite the content might be incorrect.
# On the other hand, an uncertain tone can create another illusion the information may not be reliable, despite the content is correct.


# Concepts Question 3
#
# The steps below make up a complete RAG pipeline, but they are out of order.
# Copy the list into your code as a comment, arrange them in the correct order, and add a one-sentence description of what happens at each step.

steps = [
    "Generate a response from the LLM",
    "Extract text from source documents",
    "Receive the user's query",
    "Retrieve the most relevant chunks",
    "Convert text chunks into embeddings",
    "Inject retrieved chunks into the prompt"
    "Split text into chunks",
    "Embed the user's query",
]
# "Extract text from source documents" - the text in each document in the list is extracted and stored in the text variable.
# "Split text into chunks" - the system breaks down larger documents into smaller manageable chunks for processing.
# "Convert text chunks into embeddings" - the system converts each chunk into a vector embedding that captures its meaning.
# "Receive the user's query" - the bot gets the user's question they want an answer for. It repeats in an infinity loop, or until "quit" is entered.
# "Embed the user's query" - the script converts the user's query into a vector embedding to then compare with documents embeddings.
# "Retrieve the most relevant chunks" - the system compares the query embeddings with document chunks' embeddings in order to find the most relevant pieces of information to add to then the prompt.
# "Inject retrieved chunks into the prompt - the script injects the relevant chunks of data into a prompt that will be then sent to the LLM.
# "Generate a response from the LLM" - the LLM processes the given prompt which includes both the user's query and the relevant document chunks, and generates a response.

# Run simple_keyword_retrieval with verbose=True on the query and documents below. Print the name of the selected document.

# The function selected "loyalty.txt" based on reverse sorted array of scores that is a misleading, cause the word "weekends" from the query overlaps with the content of "hours.txt".
# BUT, cause of keyword-based retrieval the scores of "loyalty.txt", "hours.txt" and "hiring.txt" are the same (1), so it shows "loyalty.txt" as the first option among 3 equil ones.

# Keyword Question 2
# Run the same function with this second query using the same documents from Q1:

query = "Do you have anything without caffeine?"

# No overlapping keywords found.
# Selected document: [('None found', 'No relevant content.')]

# Add a comment explaining:
# Which document was selected
# Whether keyword RAG got this right — and why or why not
# What kind of retrieval would do better here

# - No document was selected, cause there were no overlapping keywords between the query and the documents.
# - Keyword RAG did not get this right, cause it relies on exact word overlap to retrieve relevant documents that is not very reliable. In this case the query is asking about "caffeine", but there is no "caffeine" word in documents despite "menu.txt" might have relevant information about caffeinated and non-caffeinated options.
# - A semantic retrieval would do better here, cause it could understand the meaning of the query and retrieve relevant information from "menu.txt" about caffeinated and non-caffeinated options.


# Keyword Question 3
#
# Before running any code, predict which document will be selected for the query below. Write your prediction and your reasoning as a comment first, then run the code to check.

# faq.txt, cause of "Sign up" in it
query = "How do I sign up for rewards?"

# No overlapping keywords found.
# Selected document: [('None found', 'No relevant content.')]

# Was your prediction correct? If the result surprised you, add a comment explaining what happened.
#
# My prediction was incorrect, as no document was selected.
# I expected "faq.txt" to be selected due to the phrase "Sign up" being present in it, but then I realized that "faq.txt" is not present in the "documents" list.


# --- Semantic RAG Concepts ---

# Semantic Question 1

# Add a comment block answering the following in your own words. Try not to just copy the definitions from the lesson — explaining a concept in your own words is a good sign that you have understood it.
#
# What is a vector embedding? (1-2 sentences)
# A vector embedding is how data is represented as a list of numbers (a vector) in a multi-dimensional space. The closer the vector to each other and their directions the more similar are data examples.
#
# Two text chunks have cosine similarity scores of 0.85 and 0.30 with a given query. Which chunk is more relevant, and what does that number tell you about the relationship between the texts?
# The chunk with a cosine similarity score of 0.85 is more relevant to the given query, cause their directions are closer and the data relationship with the chunk are closer, meaning they have similar meanings.
#
# Why can semantic search find a relevant chunk even when none of the exact words from the query appear in the chunk?
# Semantic search can find a relevant chunk even when none of the exact words from the query appear in the chunk, cause it relies on the meaning and context (cosine similarity scores), and not just matching specific keywords.


# Semantic Question 2
#
# Keyword RAG and semantic RAG handle the same problem differently. Copy this table into your code as a comment and fill in the right column:
#
# | Feature                    | Keyword RAG                       | Semantic RAG |
# |----------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
# | What is compared?          | Exact word overlap                | The meaning and context (cosine similarity scores)                              |
# | What is retrieved?         | Full document                     | The most relevant chunks of the document based on meaning and context           |
# | Can it handle synonyms?    | No                                | Yes                                                                             |
# | Storage format             | Plain text dictionary             | Vector embeddings in a vector database                                          |
# | Relevance score            | Number of overlapping keywords    | Cosine similarity score (0 to 1, where 1 is very similar and 0 is not similar)  |

The company approaches sustainability by not only focusing on engineering and building solar installations but also by being educators, partners, and advocates for a more resilient and equitable power grid. They emphasize community well-being, energy literacy, local empowerment, and workforce training programs to ensure a long-lasting impact beyond just energy savings.

# Add a comment explaining what you expected, what actually happened, and what you would change about the system to handle this kind of query better.
#
# - I expected the model to struggle a bit with this query, cause it is asking about the company's mission and approach to sustainability which might vague (at least from what I thought) and info split across multiple documents and not directly in a single chunk.
# BUT, the model provided a pretty comprehensive and relevant answer. I suppose, that it was able to retrieve and pack information from multiple relevant chunks effectively.
# - TBH, I don't know how to handle this kind of query better, but I heard about a graph-based retrieval that can be applicable for complex RAGs and vague questions.


# LlamaIndex Question 4
#
# Using the same index and query engine you built in Q1, evaluate one response using LlamaIndex's built-in evaluators.
# Import and instantiate a FaithfulnessEvaluator and a RelevancyEvaluator, both using gpt-4o-mini as the judge LLM (refer to the "RAG Evaluation using LlamaIndex" section of lesson 4 for the exact import and setup pattern). Run them on this query:

print("Relevancy Result: " + str(relevancy_result.score))

# Test query: What employee benefits does BrightLeaf offer?
# Faithfulness Evaluation: 1.0
# Relevancy Result: 1.0
#
# Test query: What is BrightLeaf's stock price?
# Faithfulness Evaluation: 1.0
# Relevancy Result: 0.0

# After printing both sets of scores, add a comment block answering:
#
# What does a faithfulness score of 1.0 mean? What would a score of 0.0 indicate?
# A faithfulness score of 1.0 means that the response is completely faithful to the source documents.
# In other words, all the information in the response can be supported by real information without any hallucinations or imaginary data.
# A score of 0.0 would show that the response is not faithful at all.
# In other words, it contains information that cannot be supported by the real information and likely includes hallucinations.

# What does a relevancy score measure, and how is it different from faithfulness
# - A relevancy score measures how relevant the response is to the user's query. It means how well the information in the response addresses the question asked.
# - This is different from faithfulness, that measures how the information in the response is accurate and supported by the source documents

# Did the scores change between your two queries? If so, why do you think that happened?
# - The faithfulness score did not change between the two queries, it remained at 1.0 for both.
# I think this is cause the model did not hallucinate anything in both responses.
# - BUT, the relevancy score changed significantly between the two queries (from 1.0 to 0.0).
# For the first query about employee benefits, the relevancy score was 1.0, so the response is highly relevant to the question.
# For the second query about stock price, the relevancy score dropped to 0.0, so the response is not relevant at all (stock price information was not present in the source documents).

# What is the "LLM-as-a-judge" approach, and why is it used for RAG evaluation instead of a simple accuracy metric?
# - The "LLM-as-a-judge" approach uses LLM to check the quality of responses from another LLM in a RAG system.
# - This approach is used for RAG evaluation, cause it helps with a more holistic and detailed assessment of the responses.
# It is useful when simple metrics can't capture for example a partial correctness or relevance.

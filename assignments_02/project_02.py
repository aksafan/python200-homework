# Are any signs (positive or negative) surprising given what you know about the data?
# For any surprising result, add a comment with your best explanation.
# Then compare train R² to test R² -- are they close, or is there a gap?
# What does that tell you about the model?

# The largest positive coefficients are for internet, higher, studytime, sex, Medu, Fedu, and the largest negative are for schoolsup and failures.
# The schoolsup (Extra educational support from the school (remedial help, tutoring)) was surprisingly with a negative coefficient.
# This is strange, cause I thought an additional support should be helpful.
# As for the positives they were expected, as students who have Internet and want to pursue higher education tend to perform better in their final grades.
# The positive signs for studytime, Medu, and Fedu are also expected, as more study time and higher parental education levels are usually associated with better academic performance.
# The Train R^2: 0.175 and the Test R^2: 0.154 are relatively close, so the model is not overfitting and should have had a reasonable generalization to unseen data.
# BUT the R² values are relatively small, so there might be other better features.

# Finally, add a comment answering: if you were deploying this model in production, which features would you keep and which would you drop? Justify your choices based on what you see in the numbers.
# For production, I'd keep features with a high coefficients that are relevant, e.g.: internet, studytime, higher, Medu/Fedu.


# Task 6: Evaluate and Summarize
# A useful way to evaluate a regression model visually is a predicted vs actual plot.
# This is a scatter plot where each point in the test set becomes a dot, with the model's prediction (y_hat) on the x-axis
# and the true value (y) on the y-axis.
# If the model were perfect, every point would fall exactly on the diagonal (predicted = actual).
# Clusters or curves away from the diagonal reveal systematic errors that RMSE alone won't show you.
# Random scattering around the diagonal is expected, and acceptable, prediction error.
# Create this plot for your test set. Add a diagonal reference line (for y=y_predicted), a title "Predicted vs Actual (Full Model)", labeled axes, and save to outputs/predicted_vs_actual.png.

# Best model test R^2 is 0.154, so it explains about 15.4% of the variation in final grades.
# Largest positive coefficients: internet (+0.834) and higher (+0.610).
# Largest negative coefficients: schoolsup (-2.062) and failures (-1.145).

# One surprising result as I mentioned above is the strong negative coefficient for schoolsup
# A possible explanation might be that if students received support they may already be struggling a lot with their studying

# Add a comment addressing these questions: does a high R² here mean G1 is causing G3?
# Is this a useful model for identifying students who might struggle?
# What might educators need to do if they wanted to intervene early, before G1 is even available?

# A high R^2 here does not mean a causation, cause G1 is mainly a very strong early indicator of later performance
# This model is useful for only short-term predictions and only after first-period grades are available
# For earlier intervention (before G1 is even available), schools need to think about other signals, e.g.: attendance patterns, study habits, support access, prior records, etc.
